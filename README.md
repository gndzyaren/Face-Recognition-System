# Face-Recognition-System

The project is basically for face recognition system.The steps are below.
******************************************************************************************************
1--->Picture turns to gray
2--->Eliminate the faces and draws a rectangle to detect the faces on the video
3--->Eliminate the eyes and draws a rectangle to detect the eyes on the video.
4--->Writes the rectangular shapes and the recognition faces to another sample video output.
******************************************************************************************************

**This is not very useful technique to detect face recognition.It is the baby step for computer visualization.
(I used haarcascading system and 
Viola Jones Algorithm and Integral picture)

**Codes are written in Python.
The necessary tools to use:
  PyCharm for Python
  Anaconda3 
  Tensorflow
